Create RESTful Web services using JAX-RS that allow the interaction with at least one JPA entity, implementing CRUD operations. 
The application will offer a resource containing the following services:
  - adding a new document to the database
  - replacing an existing document
  - deleting an existing document
  - returning a "list" of the documents that were uploaded
  - Use JSON for representing consumed or produced data
